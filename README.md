Hi there, I'm Pedro Augusto. I have a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Goiás and I'm currently studying full stack development.

## 🎓 Undergraduate Studies

During college, I became particularly interested in theoretical areas of computer science, which led me to write my undergraduate thesis in Graph Theory and then publish an article based on it.

I've also built backend-focused projects in languages such as C/C++, Python, Lua and Java — including a language interpreter, a compiler, a restaurant system and several others. You can find some of them in my pinned repositories.

## 🎯 Current Goal

After initially dedicating myself to the academic research area, I started exploring other paths and am currently studying to become a full stack developer. I've already built some interesting projects, which can be found in [fullstack-journey](https://github.com/PedroASB/fullstack-journey) repository.
